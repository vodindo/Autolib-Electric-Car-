# Autolib-Electric-Car-
Defining the question

# Specifying the Data Analytic Question:

# a)Problem Statement

Investigate a claim about the blue cars from the autolib dataset.

Null hypothesis: the average number of blue cars taken is not different than that of the blue cars returned

Alternative hypothesis: the average number of blue cars taken is different than that of the blue cars returned(Claim:)

# b) Defining the Metric for Success

The aim of the analysis is to investigate the claim described above and knowing whether or not the the average number of blue cars taken is different that of the blue cars returned

Concluding on a hypothesis test given a 95% confidence interval

# c) Understanding the context

As a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company I will be investigating the claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset. In an effort to do this, I will identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that will be made.

# d) Recording the Experimental Design

Defining the research question

Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording the observations.

Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.

Challenge the solution by providing insights on the improvements that can be made

# e) Relevance of the data

The data that was used for survey was obtained from an open datasource. The provided dataset is a daily aggregation, by date and postal code, of the number of events on the Autolib network. The dataset used ranged from January to July of 2018 and will be deemed relevant for this analysis
